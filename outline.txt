This is the "final" version of the outline from the 2017-07-28 VFAD.
Please do not modify this outline without prior discussion on
atomic-devel@projectatomic.io, as there are multiple teams using it to coordinate.

Leaf nodes of this tree, down to the third level, will be individual documents in the
final documentation.  Below the third level, they will be subheadings on a page.
Issues related to a specific page should reference this structure.  Omit annotations
like (QS).

Example Issue names:

Installation/Vagrant

Installation/Bare Metal/Managing Storage

Administration/Installing Software/OSTree Mutations

(the three items below the above are on the same page)
